Package: ALPS
Title: AnaLysis routines for ePigenomicS data
Version: 0.100.1
Author: Venu Thatikonda, Natalie JÃ¤ger
Maintainer: Venu Thatikonda <thatikonda92@gmail.com>
Description: The package provides analysis and publication quality visualization routines for genome-wide 
  epigenomics data such as histone modification or transcription factor ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, DNase-seq etc. 
  The functions in the package can be used with any type of data that can be represented with bigwig files 
  at any resolution. The goal of the ALPS is to provide analysis tools for most downstream analysis without 
  leaving the R environment and most tools in the package require a minimal input that can be prepared with 
  basic R, unix or excel skills.
